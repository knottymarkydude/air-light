## air-kmd - A minimalist WordPress starter theme


Based on Air project

air-light (or simply *Air*) is modesigned from air-light to be a minimal starting point for a WordPress project at [Digitoimisto Dude Oy](https://www.dude.fi), a Finnish boutique digital agency in the center of Jyväskylä. Theme is based on [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s).

## [Demo](https://dudetest.xyz/air)

This theme is built to be very straightforward, backwards compatible, front end developer friendly and modular by its structure. Following [Underscores](https://github.com/automattic/_s) and [WordPress Theme Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Development_Standards) best practices and most of the changes in _s are implemented as soon as they are committed.

### Extra building blocks

#### Sticky navigation

Air has sticky navigation baked in.

##### How to enable

You can enable the navigation by

1. Adding sticky-nav.js to your gulpfile (already included with [Devpackages](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/devpackages) and newtheme.sh start script)
2. Uncommeting sticky-nav import in global.scss
3. Restart gulp and save scripts.js once to compile working combined javascript file

#### Slick slider

Air includes sassified version, clean SCSS file for slick carousel.

##### How to enable

To enable Slick carousel support,

1. Run `npm install slick-carousel --save` in theme directory
2. Run `npm update` in theme directory
3. Uncomment `themeDir + '/node_modules/slick-carousel/slick/slick.js'` in gulpfile.js
4. Start gulp again, add slick init to document ready in scripts.js, like this, tweak to your needs (already uncommented):

```` javascript
$('.slider').slick({
  slidesToShow: 1,
  slidesToScroll: 1,
  arrows: true,
  dots: false,
  fade: true
});
````

5. Construct your slider like this:

```` html
<div class="block block-slider">
  <div class="container slider">
    <div class="item">
      <p><b>Slider item 1</b> Some other content. Lorem ipsum in proident deserunt nostrud. Lorem ipsum in proident deserunt nostrud.</p>
    </div><!-- .item -->

    <div class="item">
      <p><b>Slider item 2</b> Something different to see the change. Lorem ipsum in proident deserunt nostrud culpa veniam sed esse aliqua ea velit aute.</p>
    </div><!-- .item -->
</div><!-- .block -->
````

Please note: If you want to change the background to lighter, you will need to edit the svg arrows accordingly.

#### WooCommerce support

Air had by default a basic WooCommerce support [from version 1.9.2](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-kmd/commit/55c539bb9cd2e35fdbfdf4f39a136c542b42b884), and for a while it was been separated to its own repository, [air-woocommerce](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-woocommerce) since v2.5.6.

##### How to enable

Starting from v2.6.0 WooCommerce support comes with [Air helper](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-helper) plugin and Air contains optional very basic WC styles. Air helper will add it's WC functionality when theme support for WooCommerce is added. To enable:

1. Get [Air helper](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-helper)
2. Activate the plugin
3. Uncomment woocommerce import in global.scss
4. Run gulp again and save files

### Requirements

* Requires at least: WordPress 4.7.0
* Tested up to WordPress 4.9.6

### Recommendations for development

* Mac OS X
* [Devpackages](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/devpackages) - Npm, Gulp and Bower
* [Dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack) - A toolkit for creating a new professional WordPress project with deployments. Heavily based on Bedrock by Roots.

### Installation

Traditional way:

1. Git clone or download zip
2. Open Terminal and run `npm install`
3. Open project to Atom (or your preferred editor) and run search and replace air-kmd => yourprojectname
4. Run `gulp watch` and start coding

If you are using [Dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack) and [Devpackages](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/devpackages), your project folder is located at `~/Projects`, your vagrant box is up and running at `10.1.2.4`, just

1. Open Terminal and cd to air directory
2. Run `sh newtheme.sh` - the script takes care of the rest (updates textdomain with your project name, checks updates for air and npm packages, runs npm install, fetches devpackages, sets up gulp, cleans up the leftover files and activates the theme via wp-cli)

### Contributing

If you have ideas about the theme or spot an issue, please let us know. Before contributing ideas or reporting an issue about "missing" features or things regarding to the nature of that matter, please read [Please note](#please-note-before-using) section. Thank you very much.

### Air development

#### Installation

If you want to improve air, you have two options.

##### 1. Use dudestack

Air is originally built on [dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack). Install our development environment with these steps (unix only, sorry Windows!):

1. `mkdir ~/Projects && git clone https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack`
2. `cd ~/Projects/dudestack && sh setup.sh`
3. Run `createproject`, name project after *airdev* when asked
4. Wait for the project to be created (get a coffee, first time can take couple of minutes)
5. Create a fork of air-kmd
6. `cd ~/Projects/airdev/content/themes`
7. Fetch your fork with `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/air-kmd.git` (remember to replace yourusername with your actual username)
8. `cd ~/Projects/airdev/content/themes/air-kmd`
9. Get air dependencides by running `npm install` (if you don't have npm installed, see [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or just use [homebrew](https://brew.sh))
10. Wait npm to get through files (get a coffee)
11. Activate theme - if you are using os x lemp: `cd ~/Projects/airdev && vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/bin/wp theme activate air-kmd` if [marlin-vagrant](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/marlin-vagrant): `ssh vagrant@10.1.2.4 "cd /var/www/$PROJECTNAME/;vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/bin/wp theme activate air"`
12. Open whole project to sublime, for example with `subl -n ~/Projects/airdev/content/themes/air-kmd` if you have Sublime Text.
13. Go to back to air-kmd dir with `cd ~/Projects/airdev/content/themes/air-kmd` and then run `gulp watch` and start developing!

You may want to add `alias wp='./vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/bin/wp'` for OS X lemp stack or `alias wp='ssh vagrant@10.1.2.4 "cd /var/www/"$(basename "$PWD")"; /var/www/"$(basename "$PWD")"/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/bin/wp"'` for marlin-vagrant to get to use wp-cli with simply `wp`.

##### 2. Use your own stack

To install air-kmd to your own development environment, just clone your fork to your theme directory, activate the theme, and make changes. If you make changes to front-end (JS/SCSS), you'll need to use our gulpfile and npm dependencies, so make sure you go through steps 9-10 and 12 above.

When you make changes, commit them with clear describing commit messages and them make a pull request. We are happy to accept improvements!

##### Content and unit tests

Next you just need to add content and menu via [airdev.test/admin](http://airdev.test/), or you can use the ready-made content:

1. `cd ~/Projects/airdev`
2. `wp plugin install wordpress-importer --activate`
3. `wget https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/demo/theme-unit-test-data.xml`
4. `wp import theme-unit-test-data.xml --authors=create`

### Debuggers

air-kmd comes with [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) built inside gulpfile.js. **Please note, you need to configure these separately!**

PHP_CodeSniffer needs to be installed under `/usr/local/bin/phpcs` with [WordPress-Coding-Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) for php-debuggers to work properly in gulp. If you don't want to use phpcs with gulp, you can disable it by commenting out or deleting line `gulp.watch(phpSrc, ['phpcs']);`.


### Notes

Gzip file sizes tested with `wc -c css/global.css` and `gzip -c css/global.css | wc -c` commands.

**Theme developers please note:** if you use phpcs in [SublimeLinter as custom standard](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/sublime-settings/blob/master/Library/Application%20Support/Sublime%20Text%203/Packages/User/SublimeLinter.sublime-settings#L47) on [dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack), you will need extra content/themes/air-kmd subfolders inside theme directory for it to work on both global projects and with air-kmd.
